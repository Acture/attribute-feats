# AC's Homebrew

> Formerly **AttributeFeats**. The UMM mod Id and install folder (`AttributeFeats`) and all feat IDs are unchanged, so existing settings and saves keep working. The assembly is now `ACHomebrew.dll`.

A Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous mod of homebrew feats that open up play styles: attribute conversion, close-quarters and long-range fighting, retaliation, stealth, solo play, summoning swarms, spell-slot tricks, immunity piercing and more.

> **Design philosophy:** each feat should be about as strong as a slightly-better vanilla or modded feat (or class feature), and cover only two or three effects or one system. Limits and exclusions are configurable, and stronger versions are reserved for mythic feats.

## Feat Families

During character creation and level-up, expand **AC's Homebrew**, then a **feat family**, then choose the **individual feat** (Main Attribute Mastery has one more level: source attribute, then target). Each choice grants one feat. You can return to a family at later feat choices, subject to prerequisites, the [feat budget](#feat-budget) and [exclusion groups](#exclusion-groups). Existing characters keep their learned feats.

Families are grouped by play theme below. Numbers are first-pass values, and **nothing in this release has been verified in the game yet**; see [validation](doc/validation.md).

### Attributes

**Main Attribute Mastery (30 feats, one per character).** Choose a source attribute, then one other attribute: add the source modifier (minimum 0) to the target score as an inherent bonus. The six broad 0.1.x Main feats (Titan's Apotheosis, Quicksilver Incarnate, Adamantine Vessel, Architect of Self, Ocular of the Cosmos, Sovereign of Wills) are retired: no longer offered, kept for characters that have them, and narrowed to half the modifier on the other five attributes. Respec to switch.

**Weapon Insight (6)** — use the attribute for weapon attack rolls.

| Feat | 中文名称 | Attribute |
|---|---|---|
| Titan's Momentum | 巨灵摧破 | Strength |
| Aldori Finesse | 阿尔多里绝诣 | Dexterity |
| Stout Grounding | 磐固千钧 | Constitution |
| Geometer's Edge | 规矩之锋 | Intelligence |
| Karmic Interception | 因果断隙 | Wisdom |
| Swashbuckler's Flourish | 游侠华彩 | Charisma |

**Extended Replacement (6)**

| Feat | 中文名称 | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Ascetic's Ward | 云水自真 | Wis-to-AC when unarmored/light armor |
| Anatomical Leverage | 筋络推演 | Int-to-CMB |
| Monarch's Stature | 帝胄岳立 | Cha-to-CMD |
| Titan's Footing | 巨灵固步 | Str-to-CMD |
| Zephyr's Grace | 穿风灵步 | Dex-to-AC when unarmored/light armor |
| Adamantine Mettle | 生机洪炉 | Con modifier to HP (minimum 0; added once) |

**Derived Stat Conversion (6)**
- **Arcane Aegis (魔能天衣)** — Half Caster Level to AC.
- **War-Hardened Reflexes (百战身魄)** — Half BAB to all saving throws.
- **Scholar's Positioning (通识御敌)** — One third of total Skill Ranks to AC.
- **Ley-Infused Vitality (灵脉淬体)** — Caster Level to Max HP.
- **Dawn of the Soul (法相初明)** — At combat start, temporary HP equal to Caster Level, for up to 10 minutes or until combat ends.
- **Blade of the Spell-Saint (剑圣咒痕)** — Half BAB to the save DC of your spells (not class or racial abilities).

**Weapon Damage (6)** — choose an attribute, then a proficient weapon category. **Replace** mode (default) uses the attribute instead of the weapon's damage attribute when that is better, keeping the normal two-handed/off-hand multiplier; **Add** mode adds the positive modifier once. Weapons that do not already add an attribute to damage gain nothing. The mode applies on the next damage calculation.

| Mode | Example: Str 12 (+1), Int 20 (+5), one-handed longsword |
|---|---|
| Replace (default) | `1d8 + 5` |
| Add | `1d8 + 1 + 5` |

**Casting Attribute (3)** — Somatic Force (力擎法脉, Strength), Sleight of Arcana (巧指弄玄, Dexterity) or Sanguine Incantation (气血炼真, Constitution): choose one of your spellbooks; it uses that attribute for save DCs, bonus spell slots, the minimum score to cast and concentration. Settings: *Casting Scope* (selected spellbook or all spellbooks) and *Casting Mode* (always, or only when higher). The spellbook screen header may still show the original attribute.

**Resource Attribute (6)** — one per attribute (Reservoir of Might 巨力盈渊, Springs of Agility 灵动渊源, Font of Endurance 骨髓蓄沛, Well of Thought 识海蕴灵, Meditative Spring 澄心源流, Sovereign Font 华威盈座): choose one of your resources whose uses grow with an ability modifier (channel energy, ki, lay on hands, performance, bloodline or domain powers, including resources from other mods); its bonus uses come from that attribute. The new maximum applies the next time the resource is restored.

### Aptitudes

Each aptitude adds the attribute modifier (untyped) to two or three themed values.

| Family | Strength | Dexterity | Constitution | Intelligence | Wisdom | Charisma |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Defensive** | Colossus Bastion (巨灵重障): CMD, Fort | Wind-Dancer's Shroud (风舞虚影): AC, Ref | Inured Carapace (百炼金身): AC, Fort | Analytical Aegis (算律之盾): Initiative, Ref | Third Eye Vigil (天目清照): Will, Initiative | Majesty's Reproach (凛然天威): Will, CMD |
| **Maneuver** | Grip of the Behemoth (比蒙扼击) | Fulcrum of the Viper (灵蛇巧掣) | Deep-Root Clinch (沉洋扼锁) | Anatomical Pivot (机理断节) | Crane's Anticipation (玄鹤听劲) | Audacious Overthrow (叱喝倾山) |
| **Skilled** | Giantwright's Craft (巨匠巧工): Athletics, Intimidate | Thief-King's Panache (妙手绝尘): Mobility, Stealth, Thievery | Ascetic Diligence (苦行研磨): Athletics, Perception | Encyclopedic Synthesis (格物万象): Arcana, World, Use Magic Device | Wanderer's Lucidity (云水澄明): Perception, Nature, Religion | Silver-Tongued Virtuoso (锦绣天潢): Persuasion, Bluff, Diplomacy |
| **Arcane** | Mage-Hammer Inscription (铁骨铸咒) | Somatic Velocity (疾影手印) | Crucible of the Conduit (鼎炉承法) | Archmage's Codex (万法源流) | Gnostic Channel (玄鉴通幽) | Sovereign Decrees (天宪法旨) |

Maneuver adds the modifier to CMB. Arcane adds it to caster level and spell penetration, and half of it to save DCs.

| Feat | 中文名称 | Attribute |
|---|---|---|

| Cadence Decoded | 阅破机宜 | Intelligence | Weapon attack resolves; up to 10 minutes, removed at combat boundaries |

**Distance Damage (9)** — three styles of three feats; each feat adds up to +4 damage, the three feats of one style stack to +12, and a character can follow only one style.

| Style | Feat | Scores |
|---|---|---|
| Close (melee) | Point-Blank Ruin (咫尺绝杀) | Hit distance: +4 pressed against the target, −1 per 1.5 ft |

**Survival** — Undying (向死而生): when damage drops you to 0 HP or lower, you cannot die and keep acting for 1 hour; if you are not healed above the death threshold by then, you die.

### Magic

## Settings

> Applied immediately: Weapon Damage Mode, the feat budget, exclusion groups, Casting Scope/Mode and Truly Solo pets. Other settings require restarting. With [ModMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous) installed, the same settings also appear on an AC's Homebrew page in the game's options screen; both write the same settings file.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Weapon Damage Mode (`WeaponDamage`) | `Replace` | Replace uses a better chosen attribute instead of the existing damage attribute; Add adds the positive modifier once. |
| Feat count limit (`EnableFeatCountLimit`, `MaxFeatCount`) | OFF, 6 | Maximum number of Homebrew feats per character. See [Feat Budget](#feat-budget). |
| Feat point limit (`EnableFeatPointLimit`, `MaxFeatPoints`) | OFF, 10 | Maximum total Homebrew feat cost per character. Can be enabled together with the count limit. |
| Exclusion groups (`EnableMutex`, `FeatGroups`) | ON | Master switch plus a switch and limit for each [exclusion group](#exclusion-groups). |
| Casting Scope (`CastingScope`) | `SelectedSpellbook` | Casting Attribute feats change the chosen spellbook, or all spellbooks. |
| Casting Mode (`CastingMode`) | `Always` | Use the feat's attribute always, or only when it is higher than the spellbook's own. |
| Truly Solo pets (`TrulySoloCountsPets`) | OFF | Pets in the party reduce the number of absent companions. |
| Meme feats (`EnableMemeFeats`) | OFF | Registers the Meme menu (restart required). |
| Power Level | `Balanced` | `Balanced`: full scaling for attributes, defenses, maneuvers, skills, caster level and spell penetration; reduced scaling for spell DC, BAB and Power Mode bonuses. `Legacy_AllFull`: all rank-based bonuses use full scaling. |
| Include Self in Attribute Stack | OFF | A retired broad Main feat may add its attribute to itself. |
| EnableAttributes, EnableDefenses, EnableManeuvers, EnableChecks, EnableSkills, EnableCasterDC, EnableCasterLevel, EnableSpellPenetration | ON | Gate the corresponding bonuses of the attribute and aptitude feats. |
| EnableBAB | OFF | Main Attribute Mastery also adds reduced scaling to Base Attack Bonus. |
| EnablePowerMode | OFF | Main Attribute Mastery also adds attack bonus, damage, AoOs, sneak attack, HP, speed and fixed +1 reach. Intentionally overpowered. |

## Feat Budget

The optional feat budget limits each character's Homebrew feats across all families. Enable a **count limit**, a **point limit**, or both, and set their maximums (0–99) in the mod settings. Changes apply on the next selection check, without restarting.

| Cost | Families |
|---|---|
| 3 | Retired broad Main feats |
| 2 | Main Attribute Mastery, Weapon Insight, Extended Replacement, Derived Stat Conversion, Weapon Damage, Casting Attribute, Stance, Greater Summoning, Summoner Sacrifice, Spell School/Descriptor Specialist, Arcana, Stealth, Solo, Survival, Penetration |
| 1 | Defensive, Maneuver, Skilled and Arcane aptitudes, Resource Attribute, Conditional Trigger, Distance Damage, Long-Reach Gambit, Momentum, Execution, Reactive Armor, Retaliation, Summoner, Growth |
| 0 | Meme |

- Only feats granted to the character count. Opening the AC's Homebrew menu or a family menu is free, and vanilla or other mods' feats are never counted.
- Each parametrized choice (for example each Weapon Damage weapon category or Casting Attribute spellbook) is a separate feat with its own cost. A feat with multiple ranks counts once per rank.
- Picks earlier in the same level-up count toward later picks. Cancelling or changing a pick frees its budget; later picks that no longer fit are removed from the level-up, as with other prerequisites. Respec frees all budget.
- Feat tooltips show used and maximum feats or points, the feat's cost and why it cannot be chosen. The mod settings list each party member's usage.
- Effects that ignore feat prerequisites, such as the Trickster's, do not bypass the budget.
- Lowering a limit or loading an older save never removes feats. A character above the limit keeps every feat and its effects, is shown as over budget, and cannot choose more Homebrew feats until the limit is raised or the character is respecced.

## Exclusion Groups

Each group limits how many of its feats one character may own. Every group has its own switch and limit in the settings; `EnableMutex` turns all of them off. Changes apply immediately.

| Group | Members | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Main Attribute Mastery | All Main feats, including retired ones | 1 |
| Defensive / Maneuver / Skilled / Arcane | Each aptitude family | 1 each |
| Stance, Weapon Insight, Weapon Damage attribute, Greater Summoning, Summoner Sacrifice, Spell School, Spell Descriptor, Reactive Armor | Each family | 1 each |
| Conditional Trigger | The six triggers | 2 |
| Attribute replaces AC / CMD | Ascetic's Ward + Zephyr's Grace / Monarch's Stature + Titan's Footing | 1 each |
| Derived AC; Caster level to HP | Arcane Aegis + Scholar's Positioning; Ley-Infused Vitality + Dawn of the Soul | 1 each |
| Attribute bonuses to AC | AC aptitudes, AC stances, AC replacements and Defiance at the Precipice | 2 |
| One distance style | Close, mid and long feats exclude each other; feats within a style stack | ON |
| Same attribute across Main, aptitudes and stances | One feat keyed to each attribute | OFF |
| Casting and resource attribute | One feat per spellbook and per resource | Always on |

Main Attribute Mastery uses **inherent** bonuses, so it does not stack with tomes and wishes; most other bonuses are untyped or replace an attribute.

## Installation (Unity Mod Manager)

1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21) for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.
2. Build or download `ACHomebrew-0.1.2.zip`.
3. Drop the zip into UMM.
4. Enable the mod in-game.

## Save Compatibility

- **Upgrading to AC's Homebrew** keeps every existing feat GUID, the UMM Id and the install folder. The six broad Main feats are retired but stay on characters that have them, with narrowed effects; respec to pick the new Main Attribute Mastery. Several families were narrowed (aptitudes, the Wisdom stance, Defiance at the Precipice, Blade of the Spell-Saint, Summoner Sacrifice) and the distance feats were rebuilt; existing characters get the new effects on load. Exclusion rules are now checked at selection time and no longer stored on blueprints.
- Settings files without budget, exclusion group, casting or meme fields use the defaults. Settings files without `WeaponDamage` default to `Replace`; both damage modes use the same new feat GUIDs, so switching modes requires no respec.
- **0.1.1 → 0.1.x is non-breaking.** Settings carry over; XML serialization adds the new `EnableMutex` field as `true` by default.
- **0.1.0 → 0.1.1 upgrades** keep all existing feats (GUIDs unchanged). New feats appear in the level-up feat list and Commanding Presence Stance now has its 30-ft ally aura wired; its Charisma scaling source still requires in-game verification.
- 0.0.x → 0.1.x is a redesign; back up saves first.

## Building from Source

- Set `WrathInstallDir`, `WrathPath`, or `WRATH_PATH`, or let the project generate the ignored, repository-root `GamePath.props` from `Player.log`.
- From the repository root, run `dotnet build ACHomebrew.slnx -p:DeployMod=false` to compile without deploying to the game.
- To build the release ZIP without deploying to the game, run `dotnet build ACHomebrew.slnx -c Release -p:DeployToGame=false`.
- Build output is in `artifacts/bin/ACHomebrew/<Configuration>/`; intermediate files are in `artifacts/obj/`.
- To deploy, run `dotnet build ACHomebrew.slnx`. The Deploy target copies files into the local UMM mod folder and creates `artifacts/packages/ACHomebrew-<Version>.zip`.
- Run the game-independent repository checks with `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Test-RepositoryContracts.ps1`. These check blueprint IDs and loader metadata; they do not test combat effects.

- Run the standalone damage calculation checks with the .NET 10 SDK: `dotnet run --project tests/WeaponDamage.Tests`.
- Run initialization failure checks with `dotnet run --project tests/Initialization.Tests`. These exercise the real registry and menu orchestration with stand-ins for game/BlueprintCore APIs and family creation; they do not start Unity or verify in-game UI behavior.
- With Windows PowerShell 5.1, check settings compatibility using `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests/VerifySettings.ps1 -WrathInstallDir "<game directory>"`.
- After compiling, verify live mode switching on an existing component with `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests/VerifyLiveWeaponDamageMode.ps1 -WrathInstallDir "<game directory>"`. This loads the compiled mod and game types without starting Unity.
- With a local game installation, run `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Invoke-OfflineMechanicsTests.ps1`. It uses the public [wotr-testing](https://github.com/Acture/wotr-testing) submodule (`git submodule update --init -- external/wotr-testing`), loads the real game assemblies and blueprint pack in a test process without starting the game, and applies feats to vanilla units. See [offline mechanics tests](doc/offline-mechanics-testing.md) for inputs, adaptations and limits.

GitHub Actions runs the repository checks on Windows and Linux. GitHub-managed
CodeQL default setup scans C# and Actions for security issues; review its results
on the latest pull-request commit before merging. These static checks do not
replace in-game behavior tests.

### Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/ACHomebrew/` | Entry project: UMM loader, registration order, icons, `App.config`, loader `Info.json`, optional ModMenu page and packaging (merges every project and BlueprintCore into `ACHomebrew.dll`) |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Logic/` | Game-independent logic shared with the tests: budget costs, exclusion groups, scoring rules and blueprint GUIDs |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Core/` | In-game infrastructure: feat menus, budget and exclusion enforcement, settings, localization and shared feat builders |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Attributes/` | Main Attribute Mastery, Weapon Insight and Extended Replacement, Derived Stat Conversion, Weapon Damage, casting and resource attributes |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Aptitudes/` | Defensive, Maneuver, Skilled and Arcane aptitudes |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Martial/` | Stances, Conditional Triggers, distance feats, Long-Reach Gambit, Momentum and Execution |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Defense/` | Reactive Armor and Retaliation |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Magic/` | Spell School/Descriptor Specialists and Arcana (spell slots) |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Summoning/` | Greater Summoning, Summoner Sacrifice and Summoner links |
| `src/ACHomebrew.Styles/` | Stealth, Solo and Growth |
| `src/WrathMod.props` | Shared game references and `WrathInstallDir` resolution |
| `tests/` | Test projects and compatibility baselines |
| `external/wotr-testing/` | Public submodule with the offline game test library and runner |
| `scripts/`, `.github/` | Local commands and CI workflows |
| [doc/](doc/README.md) | Public documentation |
| `notes/` | Optional private notes submodule |
| `artifacts/` | Ignored build outputs, intermediate files, packages and test reports |
| `vendor/wotr/` | Optional ignored snapshot of game files for offline tests; never committed |

The root keeps `ACHomebrew.slnx`, shared build configuration, repository
configuration, README, CHANGELOG and `Repository.json`. The local `GamePath.props`
is shared by the Mod and test projects and must not be committed.

## Text and Icons

Every feat and selection menu has English and Simplified Chinese names and descriptions. The original 92 feats and 60 feats added in AC's Homebrew have individual 128×128 PNG icons ([contact sheet](doc/feat-icons.png)). Main Attribute Mastery feats reuse their source attribute's icon; the six Weapon Damage feats do not yet have bespoke artwork. Names and lore, along with the new menu and Weapon Damage descriptions, live in the embedded [FeatText.json](src/ACHomebrew.Core/Localization/FeatText.json). Other rule templates remain with their implementations.

See the [icon contact sheet](doc/feat-icons.png), [asset manifest](doc/icon-manifest.json), and [validation commands and limits](doc/validation.md). The settings UI remains in English. Source checks and builds do not establish actual combat effects or in-game text layout.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Documentation

| Location | Audience and content | Access |
|---|---|---|
| [doc/](doc/README.md), README and CHANGELOG | Public usage, setup, supported behavior and contributor documentation | Included in the public code repository |
| `notes/` | Internal design drafts, investigations, experiment records and local mod inventories | Optional submodule; separate private-repository permission required |

Publish reviewed, user-facing documentation in `doc/` with the code. Keep internal
working records in `notes/`; public documentation and builds must remain usable
without it.

## Internal design and research notes

Design proposals, compatibility investigations and testing research live in the
private [project notes](notes/首页.md). The `notes/` Git submodule
uses the existing [Acture/obsidian-vault](https://github.com/Acture/obsidian-vault)
repository and its `project/attribute-feats` branch. Only edit this project's notes
at that checkout's root. Public installation instructions and the changelog remain
in this repository; building or using the mod does not require private notes access.

Cloning or forking this public repository does not grant access to the private
vault. The public `.gitmodules` file and gitlink expose its repository URL,
configured branch and pinned commit ID, but do not contain the notes or their Git
history. GitHub still requires separate authorization to fetch those contents.
Without it, recursive cloning or initializing `notes/` will fail at that step;
use the public clone command below instead.

The central vault's [project onboarding guide](https://github.com/Acture/obsidian-vault/blob/master/项目接入.md)
owns the shared workflow and push checks. The commands below apply it to this
project; they do not set up another synchronization system.

### Clone and initialize

For public code and documentation, skip the optional private submodule:

```powershell
git clone --no-recurse-submodules https://github.com/Acture/attribute-feats.git
```

With authenticated access to the private notes repository:

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Acture/attribute-feats.git
cd attribute-feats
```

For an existing clone or a new worktree, initialize the version recorded by its
current code commit:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive -- notes
git submodule status -- notes
git -C notes rev-parse HEAD
```

The parent repository records an exact notes commit. Initialization normally
leaves the submodule in detached HEAD; the `branch` entry in `.gitmodules` selects
the remote update source, but does not automatically check out an editable branch.
Use `git submodule update --init --recursive -- notes` after switching code
versions to restore their recorded notes version, only when the notes worktree is clean.

### Update and edit

First inspect `git status` and `git -C notes status`. Preserve any uncommitted
notes and unpublished commits before switching branches or updating the gitlink.
Fetch and check that the current notes commit is already part of the published
project branch:

```powershell
git -C notes fetch origin
git -C notes log --oneline origin/project/attribute-feats..HEAD
```

If the last command lists commits, stop and reconcile that work before switching.
For the first edit in a newly initialized clone, create the local tracking branch:

```powershell
git -C notes switch -c project/attribute-feats --track origin/project/attribute-feats
```

If that local branch already exists, use `git -C notes switch project/attribute-feats`
instead. Then update without rewriting history:

```powershell
git -C notes merge --ff-only origin/project/attribute-feats
git -C notes branch --show-current
```

Stop on divergence; do not force-push, discard local work, or merge the entire
vault `master` into this project branch. Follow the central guide for bringing
back changes made to this project's notes in the total vault.

Install the central repository's mandatory push boundary check in each notes
clone, and refresh it when the central checker changes. These PowerShell commands
use UTF-8 for Python on Windows and load the installer from the trusted vault:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"
git -C notes fetch origin refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
git -C notes show origin/master:.github/scripts/install_push_hook.py | python -X utf8 -c "import sys; exec(sys.stdin.read())" --repo notes --source-ref origin/master
```

This requires Python 3.10+, Git and authenticated `gh`. Keep `PYTHONUTF8=1` in the Windows shell used
for notes pushes. The installer preserves existing custom hooks and stops if they
need reconciliation. Hooks are local to a clone, are not copied by Git, and must
not be bypassed with `--no-verify`.

Edit files under `notes/`, then commit and submit the notes first. Stage only the
specific files you edited; this example stages the project homepage:

```powershell
git -C notes diff --stat
git -C notes add 首页.md
git -C notes commit -m "docs: update AC's Homebrew design notes"
$notesCommonGitDir = git -C notes rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir
python -X utf8 "$notesCommonGitDir/hooks/notes-boundary/submit_project.py" --repo notes
```

Only after that push succeeds, verify the published history and commit the parent
pointer. Run each step only if the preceding command succeeds:

```powershell
git -C notes fetch origin
git -C notes merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/project/attribute-feats
git diff --submodule=log -- notes
git add -- notes
git commit -m "docs: update project notes reference"
git push
```

The ancestor check must exit with code 0. Keep unrelated staged work out of the
pointer commit and use the code repository's normal review branch for delivery.
The vault's existing project-to-master aggregation is separate from updating this
repository's gitlink.

To follow the latest published notes without editing, start with clean, fully
published notes and run `git submodule update --remote --checkout -- notes`.
Review and commit the resulting parent pointer using the same steps above.
Avoid this command when reproducing a fixed code version; normal initialization
uses the pinned commit instead. Any legacy `doc` branch remains until its content
and history have been verified separately.
